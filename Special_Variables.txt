Variable 	Description
$0	The name of the script being executed.

$n	Positional parameters; n is a positive number representing the nth argument passed to the script (e.g., $1 is the first argument, $2 is the second, etc.).
	 Arguments after $9 must be enclosed in braces, such as ${10}.

$#	The number of arguments (positional parameters) passed to the script.

$*	All arguments passed to the script, treated as a single string. The arguments are separated by the first character of the IFS 
	(Internal Field Separator) variable, typically a space.

$@	All arguments passed to the script, treated as separate strings. This is useful when you want to preserve the individuality of arguments, 
	especially those with spaces, when enclosed in double quotes ("$@").

$?	The exit status of the last command executed. A value of 0 generally indicates success, while any non-zero value indicates an error.

$$	The process ID (PID) of the current shell or script. This is often used to create unique temporary filenames.

$!	The process ID (PID) of the last command executed in the background (using the & operator).

$-	The current options/flags set in the shell (e.g., -i for interactive, -m for monitor mode).


$_	The last argument of the previous command executed.  ==
